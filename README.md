# future-predictor
Pure-Python algorithm to predict the next value of a set of data. To be sporadically updated once not very busy.
### Plans
- Be able to determine the next statistical point given a set of data
  - Currently being worked on to have first line as number of lines to come, then the rest of code
  - Secondary way is to just iterate through all of the data with an end signified
  - Currently 1-var only
- Use no imports whatsoever (not even the math library!)
