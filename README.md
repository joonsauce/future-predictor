# future-predictor
Pure-Python algorithm to find next value of a set of data. To be sporadically updated once not very busy.
### Plans
- Be able to determine the next statistical point given a set of data
  - Either manually inputted or by importing a file such as .csv files (importing files may not be possible with no libraries imported)
- Run through different equation types (linear, quadratic, etc.)
- Use no imports whatsoever (not even the math library!)
